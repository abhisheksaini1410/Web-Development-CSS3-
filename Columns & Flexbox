		<h1>Article Title</h1>
		 Your love is golden because it always leads me to the fun side of life. I have no regrets about meeting you. It has been a life-changing moment. My days are far better. You are the woman of my dreams, who keeps me calm even in the lonely hours. I can’t love you less, dear.
		  I feel your presence even when you are not here with me. Remembering how cute you look when you smile sends butterfly down my tummy. Your face is the biggest motivation I need to keep pushing on with life.
		   I want to go on this journey of life with you, and I want to stand with you while we fight the storms that you will be facing. Am I asking for too much? I know that my life didn’t start with you, but I want to end it with you.
